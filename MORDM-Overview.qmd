## MORDM Combines Several Concepts

::: {.incremental}
- **Tradeoff Analysis**
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**
- **Robustness and Scenario Discovery**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
These do not need to be combined into a joint framework (MORDM), but are useful for a broad array of analyses.

# Multiple Objectives and Tradeoffs

## Decision-Making Often Involves Navigating Multiple Objectives/Metrics

- Different stakeholders often have different priorities, values, and objectives.
- Classical prescriptive approaches:
    - *Post-hoc* analysis
    - Formulate as constraints
    - Combine into a single utility function

## Multiple Objectives in CRM

:::


## ...But What If We Don't Know Thresholds/Weights?

Often it is not *a priori* clear what relevant constraints or utility weights ought to be (or can be).

We may also not know which objectives are in tension with each other.

## Tradeoffs Can Be Understood through Exploratory Analyses

We can search the outcome space to understand:

1. Which objectives are synergistic/antagonistic;
2. What the achievable ranges of these objectives are.

## Example: Managing Climate Change

## Dominated and Non-Dominated Solutions

However, many possible solutions will inevitable be **dominated**: they are outperformed across all possible objectives by some other solution.

A solution is **non-dominated** if the only way to improve with respect to one objective is to deterioriate with respect to another.

## Dominated Solutions and Pareto Fronts

The set of non-dominated solution is called the **Pareto front**.

For most interesting problems, the Pareto front is impossible to find analytically.

## Finding Pareto Fronts

The best we can typically do is to find an *approximate* Pareto front using a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA).

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**But**:

Do we actually think the "optimal" solution from our model is the real-world optimum? 
:::

## MOEAs and Convergence

As EAs are heuristic methods, need to be careful about convergence.

- Compare results with multiple seeds;
- If you aren't sure you've run it long enough, run it longer.

## Once We Have A Pareto Front...

...We can:

- Identify thresholds; 
- Select and analyze decision alternatives

# Robustness and Scenario Discovery

## Decision-Making and Uncertainty

Decision frameworks often simplify representations of uncertainties to facilitate optimization.

This can involve:

- Optimizing with respect to a "best estimate";
- Assuming a single probability distribution to compute moments or estimators.

## Deep Uncertainty

But often, uncertainties are **deep**: there is no consensus probability distribution, and outcomes can be driven by the choice of distribution.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
For example:

- What will future CO~2~ emissions be?
- How will future changes to technology impact energy use?
:::

## Example: Projecting CO~2~ Emissions

:::

## Robustness and Deep Uncertainty

If we have to make these assumptions, how can we understand the robustness of a resulting solution?

In this context, **robustness** refers to the ability of a system to achieve "good" outcomes under deviations from the design assumptions.

## What Is Robustness?

More formally:

::: {.quote}
> [Robustness is] "the insensitivity of system design to errors, random or otherwise, in the estimates of those parameters affecting design choice" 

::: {.cite}
-- Matalas and Fiering (1977); via [Herman et al (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000509)
:::
:::

## What Are "Good" Outcomes?

Important to be specific: there are many different ways to conceptualize and measure robustness.

- Ability to achieve a threshold across different states of the world?
- Degradation from "optimal" outcome under perfect information?
- Something else?

## Needs For Robustness Analysis

1. Metric for robustness
2. Alternative States of the World/Uncertainty Representations

# Sensitivity Analysis and Scenario Discovery

## What Drives Outcomes (Or Lack of Robustness)?

Once we have done our exploratory or robustness analysis, it's likely that many states of the world do not perform adequately.

Two main tools for understanding which scenarios lead to different outcomes (and why):

1. Sensitivity Analysis
2. Scenario Discovery

## Sensitivity Analysis

:::: {.columns .v-center-containers}
::: {.column width=50%}
**Sensitivity Analysis** involves identifying or ranking the model factors that most (or least) influence model outputs.

## Types of Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analyses can be broadly categorized as **local** or **global**.

- **Local SA**: Vary uncertain factors around reference value(s)
- **Global SA**: Vary uncertain factors across entire range.

Can also vary factors **one-at-a-time** or **jointly**.

## Example: Baseline CO~2~ Emissions

## Key Considerations for SA

1. Local vs. Global/OAT vs. Joint
2. How many model evaluations do you need/what is the computational complexity of the model?
3. What range/distribution is being used for each factor?
4. What is the design of experiments/sampling strategy?

## Scenario Discovery

**Scenario Discovery** refers to the identification of consequential states of the world/scenarios.

For example:

- What states of the world result in a loss of adequate performance/outcomes?
- Are there different modes/clusters of similar outcomes?

## Approaches for Scenario Discovery

- Clustering
- Machine Learning Classifiers (PRIM, CART, SVMs, ANNs)

## Example: Water Scarcity

:::

## Key Questions for Scenario Discovery

1. Is the discovery of "types" of outcomes, or do you have a classification (acceptable/not)?
2. What next? How do we communicate/illustrate/synthesize the results?


# Discussion

## Discussion Points

- How can we incorporate these concepts into projects/proposals?
- Are there valuable training resources/opportunities for students/postdocs?
- How to incorporate as part of a stakeholder-driven project?
    - Key challenges: communication and interpretability.
